# Front-end-Portfolio-Project

I will create an application using the PURSUIT API for products data.

### User Stories

- As a user when I visit the website, I will see images of multiple products.
- I will be able to click on the product images to get the details about that product.
- As a user I will be able to select a category from a dropdown button and get details about a particular product belonging to that category.
- Based on those details I will shop for that product.
